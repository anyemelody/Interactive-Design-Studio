Express my personal perspective of interactive design based on the usability.gov definition on interaction design.
(https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/interaction-design.html)
Interaction design is designing the interaction between the users and products.
The questions need to be considered when design for interaction.
1. Define how users interact with the interface?
   When starting design the interaction, I will firstly consider what aim or goal of the interaction. Based on the aim, I will define the interactive ways to reach the goal or make the process make sense. Personally I think the most difficult thing is to design reasonable interactive forms. Usually designing interaction that according to users' evocative gestures in daily lives will be easy for them to engage into.
2. Clues to help users easily get familiar with the function or operation.
3. Do something to prevent the error or mitigate the consequences.
4. Consider the feedback and response time.
   That related to the motion, sounds and dynamic things that give feedback to users.
5. Reasonable interactive ways.
6. easy to learn.
